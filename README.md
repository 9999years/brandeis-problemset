# The `problemset` document class

Brandeis University's computer science (“cosi”) courses often assign “problem
sets” which require fairly rigorous formatting. The `problemset` document
class, which extends `article`, provides a simple way to typeset these problem
sets in LaTeX.

See `problemset.tex` for documentation.
